## Jessica Vreeswijk - @jvreeswijk80 ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Jessica. I'm an experienced project and program manager making a career pivot to coding. I am fascinated by the transformation of knowledge work that AI is causing and I am excited to be part of identifying the high leverage applictions that will propel us to next level. I learned to code in Pascal, Javascript and C++ a million years ago and have only done some minor VisualBasic for Applications coding in the last 20 years. So I'm on a learning journey starting with Python, Cursor, GitHub and AI APIs.
